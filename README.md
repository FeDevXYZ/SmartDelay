📘 smartDelay() – Bitwave

⚙️ What is it?
An Arduino/ESP32 function that acts like delay, but doesn't block the rest of your code.

❌ Why avoid delay()?
It blocks the entire microcontroller

No input or sensor reading during the wait

No multitasking possible

✅ Why use smartDelay()?
Keeps your program active while waiting

You can read sensors, handle buttons, update displays

Works like delay() in timing but without freezing everything

🧠 How does it work?
It uses millis() to measure elapsed time without blocking

📌 Note
Don’t use delay() inside smartDelay() — it would defeat the non-blocking purpose.
