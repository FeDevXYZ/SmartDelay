// smartDelay by Bitwave
// Works like delay(), but lets the rest of your code breathe

void smartDelay(float seconds) {
  unsigned long duration = (unsigned long)(seconds * 1000);
  unsigned long start = millis();

  while (millis() - start < duration) {
    // ⚙️ Non-blocking zone
    // You can read sensors, check buttons, etc.
    // Just don't put delay() in here!
  }
